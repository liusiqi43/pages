<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<p>
    I'm a Research Engineer at DeepMind where I work on
    challenging open problems in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
    My current focus sits at the intersection of Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

    I grew up in China, moved to France in 2011 to study and I'm now living and
    working in London. <a href="cv.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a>
